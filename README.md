Project goal: look at the different pricing trends for houses in the King County area. Determine some key trends and how they relate to houring prices.

Data source: This dataset contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015.Data was obtained from Kaggle.com

Interactive table: this allows to filter the raw data set by the construction year of the property as well as its specific zipcode. The former uses a slider while the latter uses as dropdown selection. You will see only the top 50 results.

Interactive histogram: by using the dropdown, we can select one of multiple factors including the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, floors, and number of spots with a view at the property and compare these to the selling price. This shows how common certain features are at each price point by using a count function.

Interactive scatterplot: by using the dropdown, we can select one of multiple factors including the number of living, lot and above square footage and compare these to the selling price. This shows how common certain features are at each price point by focusing on data distribution. We do all this while deviding the properties in age groups, these are determined by the difference in the year the property was built and our current year, 2023.
